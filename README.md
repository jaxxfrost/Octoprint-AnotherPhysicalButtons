# OctoPrint-Anotherphysicalbuttons

## What this does

This is another plugin to hook up to physical buttons via the GPIO ports. I wanted six buttons - toggling heating, disengaging steppers, home, manual level corners, jog up and pause print.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

## Configuration

Explanations are in tooltops on the setup page.
